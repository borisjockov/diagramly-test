1 Development
-------------

For development, check out the mxgraph project from CVS and make it accessible
via devhost.jgraph.com:80 (use devhost URL parameter to change). Add dev=1 URL
parameter to access index.html with mxClient.js and grapheditor from mxgraph.

For development of the Embed.js source code make sure to restart the run the
build-reader Ant script, restart the EmbedServlet and clear the browser cache
on each change. This is needed because the servlet caches the JS code and only
uses the correct last-modified headers if it was deployed to GAE. 

2 Deployment
------------

The build.xml Ant script will use etc/build/mxClient.js and the code for the
grapheditor example from ../mxgraph.

The built-reader.xml Ant script will use the for mxClient from ../mxgraph.
(The reader is used for read-only embedded diagrams in external pages.)

To deploy Diagramly:

1. Update diagramly.min.js by running etc/build/build.xml with Ant
1. Update reader.min.js by running etc/build/build-reader.xml with Ant
2. Create a ChangeLog entry with a version number and a timestamp
3. Commit all changes and tag the CVS module using diagramly-m_n_r_b
4. Deploy using Google, Deploy to App Engine (use version dia2)
